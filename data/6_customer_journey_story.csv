account_111,"This customer is a large business in the finance industry, with an annual revenue of $290.82M. They held a contract with an ACV of $75,000 and went through 4 contracts over the last 59 months. Their last contract ran from 2023-11-01 to 2024-10-31, and they churned shortly after that.","During their final contract, there were no measurable CSM touchpoints. Activity scores remained at zero, and no support tickets were recorded. Meanwhile, product usage fluctuated?rising briefly mid-cycle but dropping sharply toward the end.

Given no support activity and declining usage, does this signal complete disengagement? How could we better catch this earlier?","Keeper’s Suggestion to CSM Sarah: This account showed early red flags—zero support contact, declining usage, and no CSM interaction. It’s understandable you may have had many accounts to manage, but this case highlights how easily quiet disengagement can lead to churn.

What interventions work best for reversing early churn indicators like this?","Keeper’s Suggestion to CSM Ravi: This account had strong engagement early on but has gone quiet recently. They haven’t opened support tickets, and usage in core areas like reporting has dropped. This could be a signal that they’re struggling or reprioritizing internally.
